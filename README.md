## Knowledge

- There are three functions of this repository:
	- organize the require knowledge(math, ml, dl, rl, nlp, cv theory)
	- build a knowledge base of state of art artifical intelligence work，understand the boundaries of current research
	- make cool things

- To better distinguish file types, the abbreviations in filenames have the following meanings:
	- BN ：Book Note
    - CU : Self Clear up（default）
    - OR : Operation Record

- This repository contains following files:
	- AlgorithmTree
		- The curent summary of the algorithm encountered
		- update new algorithm to this file
		- maintain levle : A
