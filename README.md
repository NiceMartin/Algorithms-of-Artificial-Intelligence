Knowledge 

- There are three functions of this repository:
  - organize the require knowledge(math, classical ml/dl/rl/nlp theory, code snippet)
  - build a knowledge base of state of art artifical intelligence work，understand the boundaries of current research
  - make cool things

- This repository contains the following
  - Operation Record
    - A-DoOnMars.md
  - Original resources
    - http://blog.csdn.net/sinat_32292481/article/details/78268553

  - This repository only contain pure knowledge(before and after), projects and code snippet contain in the fellow repositories: 
    - python : train model
      - https://github.com/Apollo2Mars/TrainModels
    - java : collect data/invoke model/supply service 
      - https://github.com/Apollo2Mars/Friday
    - RL

    - CodeSnippet
      - include some excellent code snippet
  - To better distinguish file types, the abbreviations in filenames have the following meanings:
    - BN ：Book Note
    - PN : Paper Note
    - VN : Video Note
    - CU : Clear up, this means that the content in this file is relatively mature
    - OR : Operation Record
