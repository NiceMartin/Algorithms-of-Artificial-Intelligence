# Knowledge
### Target
- make cool things

### There are two main functions of this repository:
- Combing basic knowledge of Math, Machine Learing, Deep Learing, Natural Language Processing, Graph Model, Bayesian Theory
- Plan to carding some knowledge of Genetic Algorithm, Transfer Learning, Reinforce Learning, Manifold Learning, Semi-supervised Learing
- View state of art artifical intelligence work，reach the boundaries of current research

### Abbreviations
