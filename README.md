Knowledge 

- There are three functions of this repository:
  - organize the require knowledge(math, ml, dl, rl, nlp, cv theory)
  - build a knowledge base of state of art artifical intelligence work，understand the boundaries of current research
  - make cool things

- This repository contains the following
  - Resources after process
    - Book Note
